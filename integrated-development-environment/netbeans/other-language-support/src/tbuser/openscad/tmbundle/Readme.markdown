# OpenSCAD Textmate Bundle

The builtin [OpenSCAD](http://openscad.org) editor... meh.  Put the OpenSCAD window on your second monitor, hide that ugly code editor, and turn on Automatic Reload and Compile so you can enjoy programming bliss in [TextMate](http://macromates.com) with color coding and lots of tab triggered code snippets.

Look around the bundle, there's some handy stuff in there.  Select some code and press Ctrl + or open a script with a ton of modules and click cmd+shift+T and be amazed that you lived without it this long.

## Installation

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
    git clone git://github.com/tbuser/openscad.tmbundle.git OpenSCAD.tmbundle
